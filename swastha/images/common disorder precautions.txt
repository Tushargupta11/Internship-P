**Wash your hands often:- This is especially important before and after preparing food,
                          before eating and after using the toilet.

**Get vaccinated:- Immunization can drastically reduce your chances of contracting many 
                   diseases. Keep your recommended vaccinations up-to-date.

**Use antibiotics sensibly:- Take antibiotics only when prescribed. 
                             Unless otherwise directed, or unless you are allergic 
                             to them, take all prescribed doses of your antibiotic, 
                             even if you begin to feel better before you have completed 
                             the medication.

**Stay at home if you have signs and symptoms of an infection:- 
     Don't go to work or class if you're vomiting, have diarrhea or are running a fever.

**Be smart about food preparation:- Keep counters and other kitchen surfaces clean 
                                    when preparing meals. In addition, promptly refrigerate
                                    leftovers. Don't let cooked foods remain at room 
                                    temperature for an extended period of time.

**Disinfect the 'hot zones' in your residence:-These include the kitchen and 
                                               bathroom — two rooms that can have a high 
                                               concentration of bacteria and other 
                                               infectious agents.
**Don't share personal items:- Use your own toothbrush, comb or razor blade. 
                               Avoid sharing drinking glasses or dining utensils.

**Travel wisely:- Don't fly when you're ill. With so many people confined to such a 
                  small area, you may infect other passengers in the plane. And your 
                  trip won't be comfortable, either. Depending on where your travels take 
                  you, talk to your doctor about any special immunizations you may need.



   **With a little common sense and the proper precautions, 
           you can avoid infectious diseases and avoid spreading them**
